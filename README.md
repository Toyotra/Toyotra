<p>Hey there! My name is Jad Menkara. I am an incoming 11th grade student at Vincent Massey Secondary School with a passion for engineering and design. I primarily focus on mechanical and electrical engineering and am currently leraning web-development to assist me on my tech journey.

I am currently president of Vincent Massey Hack Club and the Vincent Massey Game Jam, and do various other extracurriculars. I also love to play guitar and have been playing for over three years now.</p>
